# Azuras-Betterdiscord-Theme
This is the first betterdiscord theme im realeasing since i decided to get a better look of my own discord, and now, you can also try it out

![Theme view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70357686/165232352-b3b673b7-afa4-43c7-b57d-04f6bf2c25b9.png)

For a better experience i highly recommend you to switch to the old title bar of discord using a different plugin, so the transparency will be activated
and the looing of the theme will be better.

Also if you want to add me on Discord or if you need something you can DM me: Azura#3068

you can change and edit this theme as much as you want (free to use).
